# JavaJack: The Swing Edition - Blackjack Game

Welcome to JavaJack: The Swing Edition, a thrilling and interactive Blackjack game developed in Java with a Swing GUI and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This README provides an overview of the project and guidance on how to navigate it.

## Project Overview

JavaJack is a comprehensive Blackjack game that demonstrates the following key features:

- **Java Expertise**: Utilizes the Java programming language for game development.
- **Swing GUI**: Provides an intuitive and visually appealing graphical interface.
- **OOP Principles**: Implements robust Object-Oriented Programming principles for clean and modular code design.
- **Complex Game Logic**: Incorporates intricate game logic, including card shuffling, real-time hand updates, and win/loss determination.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to explore and navigate the project:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/yourrepository.git`

### Step 2: Navigate to the 'src' Folder

The `src` folder contains all the Java source code files, including the classes that power the Blackjack game. You'll find the following classes:

- `BlackJackGUI.java`: The main class responsible for the graphical user interface.
- `Card.java`: Represents individual playing cards.
- `Deck.java`: Manages the deck of cards, shuffling, and drawing.
- `Hand.java`: Handles player and dealer hands, card management, and game logic.

### Step 3: Explore the Code

Feel free to explore the code in each of these classes to gain a deeper understanding of how the game is implemented. You can study the methods, logic, and interactions between classes.

### Step 4: Run the Game

To run the JavaJack game on your local machine, you'll need a Java development environment set up. Use the following command within the project directory:

`javac BlackJackGUI.java`
`java BlackJackGUI`

This will launch the game, and you can start playing Blackjack with the provided GUI.

## Coming Soon

Both the "Split" and "Double Down" features as seen in traditional Blackjack are currently in progress. Additionally, bug fixes and visual/aesthetic improvements to the UI are in progress along with visual cards.
